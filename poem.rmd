"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In love's embrace, a tapestry unfolds,  
Where colors blend and stories are told.  
A symphony of hearts, in perfect tune,  
Love's ethereal dance beneath the moon.  
  
Through whispered words and tender touch,  
Love's magic weaves a bond, oh so much.  
It blossoms like flowers in spring's embrace,  
Filling the world with endless grace.  
  
Love's beauty, like a sunrise on the shore,  
Radiates warmth, forevermore.  
It paints the sky with hues divine,  
A masterpiece, where souls align.  
  
In love's gentle gaze, the stars align,  
Igniting flames, hearts intertwine.  
With every heartbeat, a melody rings,  
A serenade, that forever sings.  
  
Love's laughter, a sweet melody of joy,  
Echoes through time, no doubts destroy.  
It captures moments, like fleeting light,  
A treasure eternal, burning bright.  
  
Love's touch, a gentle breeze's embrace,  
Caresses the soul, leaving no trace.  
It heals the wounds, that life imparts,  
A balm that mends the broken hearts.  
  
In love's embrace, we find solace true,  
A sanctuary, where dreams come due.  
It lifts us high, beyond earthly strife,  
A sanctuary, where souls find life.  
  
Love's beauty blooms, like flowers in May,  
Embracing our hearts in a blissful sway.
